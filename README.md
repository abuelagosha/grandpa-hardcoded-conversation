# grandpa-conversation-website

This website is the mid-outcome of my project trying to materialize my grandpa's identity. It was created in June 2022. 

It simulates conversations between 4 relationships: 
  1) grandpa - granddaughter
  2) grandpa - grandson
  3) father-in-law - son-in-law
  4) father - daughter

The user (you) will take on the perspective of either the granddaughter, grandson, son-in-law, or daughter.

The conversation was programmed using RiveScript. 

In the conversation interface, left displays quotes from interviews with family that contextualizes my grandpa's comments displayed in the right. 


#RULES OF INTERACTION

1. Understand that the 4 different chatbots in the website represent one person constructed through his family members" perceptions.
2 Make sure to use correct punctuations.
3. The conversations may be jumpy, not fluid, short, or too long - this is meant to reflect the communication barriers existing in real-life. 
4. Always refer back to this file if you are confused at any point.
