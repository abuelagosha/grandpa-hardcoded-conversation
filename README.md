# grandpa-conversation-website

This website is the mid-outcome of my project trying to materialize my grandpa's identity. It was created in June 2022. 

It simulates conversations between 4 relationships: 
  1) grandpa - granddaughter
  2) grandpa - grandson
  3) father-in-law - son-in-law
  4) father - daughter

The conversation was programmed using RiveScript. 

In the conversation interface, left displays quotes from interviews with family that contextualizes my grandpa's comments displayed in the right.
