    <div id = "questions" class="brother">
        <p>"So I <span>attempted</span> a lot of communication with him</p>
        <span class="brs"></span>
        <p>and I can be very persistent.</p>
        <span class="brs"></span>
        <p>But you <span>can\'t</span> really make him answer questions.</p>
        <span class="brs"></span>
        <p>He <span>won\'t</span> answer your questions.</p>
        <span class="brs"></span>
        <p>He talks about things that aren\'t really related to the essence of the question."</p>
    </div>
    <div id ="hearing" class="brother">
        <p>"He also has very <span>bad hearing</span> now.</p>
        <span class="brs"></span>
        <p>He can't hear with one of his ear at all.</p>
        <span class="brs"></span>
        <p>No.. you have to shout at him <span>repeatedly.</span></p>
        <span class="brs"></span>
        <p>You need to shout <span>in front of him </span>to make conversation."</p>
    </div>

    <div id ="why" class="brother">
        <p>"I would say a two-way communication is kind of <span>impossible.</span></p>
        <span class="brs"></span>
        <p>He\'s not a man that would get persuaded.</p>
        <span class="brs"></span>
        <p>But you <span>can\'t</span> really make him answer questions.</p>
        <span class="brs"></span>
        <p>He <span>won\'t</span> answer your questions."</p>
    </div>

    <div id ="strong beliefs" class="brother">
        <p>"People have beliefs, but whether they\'re able to <span>advocate</span> them in front of other people or even <span>enforce</span> those beliefs to others really depends on the person.</p>
        <span class="brs"></span>
        <p>I think he's a man that would be willing to enforce... not enforce but to make people follow his beliefs.</p>
        <span class="brs"></span>
        <p>So he thinks he is correct.</p>
        <span class="brs"></span>
        <p>Not always but in some.. for some topics or issues."</p>
    </div>

    <div id="dream" class="brother">
        <p>"The concept of dream wasn't the same as right now.</p>
        <span class="brs"></span>
        <p>Back then, during his era, people generally thought the most ideal way to live life was contributing to society.</p>
        <span class="brs"></span>
        <p>Becoming a productive person, that itself could\'ve been the dream of an average person.</p>
        <span class="brs"></span>
        <p>I think it\'s hard to interpret it from the current sociocultural perspective..</p>
    </div>

    <div id="proud" class="brother">
        <p>"But grandpa I\'d say he\'s .. to make him happy, you have to work, <span>not show affection.</span></p>
        <span class="brs"></span>
        <p>He\'s <span>not a man to be affected by affection..</span> to make him happy, you have to show that you <span>meet his expectations.</span></p>
        <span class="brs"></span>
        <p> I\'d say he generally would\'ve been a <span>hard person to make proud." </span></p>
    </div>

    <div id="mom1" class="brother">
        <p>"I would say ... the distance with mother was <span>not too close, not too far.</span></p>
        <span class="brs"></span>
        <p>He <span>never</span> yelled at her.</span> to make him happy, you have to show that you <span>meet his expectations.</span></p>
        <span class="brs"></span>
        <p> But he yelled so many times to <span>her brother.</span></p>
        <span class="brs"></span>
        <p>My mom didn’t really get like, yelled at from her father.</p>
        <span class="brs"></span>
        <p> <span>So that kind of tells, right?" </span></p>


    </div>

    <div id="relationship" class="brother">
        <p>"Grandpa and I, we're <span>far, but close.</span></p>
        <span class="brs"></span>
        <p>Far because we don\'t exchange a lot of conversation.</p>
        <span class="brs"></span>
        <p> We don/'t meet a lot of times, and even if we meet <span>it doesn\'t seem like he\'s much interested in my personal life.</span></p>
        <span class="brs"></span>
        <p>But then again, you know, he shows signs where he <span>cares.</span></p>
        <span class="brs"></span>
        <p> He\'s <span>happy</span> when we visit him. So yeah, he\'s close and he\'s far.</p>
    </div>

    <div id="convo" class="brother">
        <p>"I don't talk to him much.. not even often. I guess whenever I see him. 3 times a year?</p>
        <span class="brs"></span>
        <p>The conversations last normally about.. It lasts around a few minutes long.</span></p>
        <span class="brs"></span>
        <p> He always asks do you study well?.. how\'s mom doing.. <span>that\'s it.</span></p>
        <span class="brs"></span>
        <p>It was always similar. Study hard. That was the biggest thing. He said
            study harder to me.</p>
        <span class="brs"></span>
        <p> <span>So that kind of tells, right?" </span></p>
     
    </div>
        
    <div id="reluctant" class="brother">
        <p>"He also has very <span>bad hearing now.</span></p>
        <span class="brs"></span>
        <p>Yeah, and I think he realizes that.</p>
        <span class="brs"></span>
        <p> <span>He\'s well aware of that,</span> so that\'s why maybe.. He\'s um he seems <span>more reluctant to engage in conversations</span> as years pass by.."</span></p>
    </div>

    <div class="dad">
        <p>"As he aged, his <span>hearing ability has significantly decreased.</span></p>
        <span class="brs"></span>
        <p>It\'s <span>hard to have normal conversations</span> these days..</p>
        <span class="brs"></span>
        <p> He wears a hearing aid ear bud in one of his ears and there are <span>lots of problems during calls.</span></p>
        <span class="brs"></span>
        <p>It\'s his biggest problem.</p>

        <br>

        <p>"You need to shout at least from <span>a meter away</span> and <span>articulate in a loud voice</span> for him to understand.</p>
        <span class="brs"></span>
        <p><span>He doesn\'t understand </span> if you try to have a normal conversation with him from further away.</p>

        <br>
        <p>I think his lifestyle is very routined, and he has a habit of saying that routines are very important in life.</p>
        <span class="brs"></span>
        <p>So I think that is what\'s most important to him.</p>
        <span class="brs"></span>
        <p>I think he expresses love by nagging at people. Like do this.. Do that.. </p>
        <span class="brs"></span>    
        <p>To him he thinks that is love, a way of showing affection.</p>


        <br>
        <p>His conversational skills are quite <span>lacking.</span></p>
        <span class="brs"></span>
        <p>I think it\'s his main weakness'.</p>
        <span class="brs"></span>
        <p>He doesn\'t have much empathy so he <span>doesn\'t really listen, ask, or react to other people\'s interests.</span></p>
        <span class="brs"></span>    
        <p>He <span>one-sidedly</span> talks about his thoughts and interests so it\'s <span>hard for a two-way conversation.</span></p>
        <span class="brs"></span>    
        <p>That\'s probably the <span>key reason why he doesn\'t, or can\'t talk with his own family</span> that much.</p>

        <br>

        <p>The prospects weren\'t too bright when he was <span>diagnosed with cancer.</span></p>
        <span class="brs"></span>
        <p>He had a very <span>strong urge to live.</span> For most people who undergo cancer treatments, their appetite would decrease but he continuously ate healthy food, exercised, and only made <span>healthy choices for his body.</span></p>
        <span class="brs"></span>
        <p>You could say he <span>beat cancer with his willpower.</span></p>

        <br>
        <p>I think he\'s<span>lonely.</span></p>
        <span class="brs"></span>
        <p>After his wife passed away, I don\'t think he has people that he particularly likes in his life..</p>
        <span class="brs"></span>
        <p>I don\'t think he knows how to be “not” lonely. You need to spend time with other people, good time, but I don\'t think he had much experience spending time with others and he doesn\'t know how to. So he spends most of his time alone.</p>
        <span class="brs"></span>    
        <p>He might not be aware of loneliness itself.</p>
        <span class="brs"></span>    
        <p>To be lonely, you need to acknowledge or feel that you want to be with others but I don\'t think he desires, or feels the need to do that. </p>

        <br>

        <p>I don\'t think he has many <span>tight-knit friends that he can really rely on.</span></p>
        <span class="brs"></span>
        <p>Most of his social activities revolve around meeting people he met from his position in society, university alumnus and bank colleagues.</p>
        <span class="brs"></span>
        <p>Not many <span>personal, close relationships.</span></p>
        <span class="brs"></span>    
        <p>He used to have regular golf meets with his university friends but after recovering from cancer I think he barely plays anymore.</p>
        <span class="brs"></span>    
        <p>So.. these days he doesn\'t have any regular meetings with <span>anyone..</span></p>

        <br>

        <p>His political stance is extreme <span>right.</span></p>
        <span class="brs"></span>
        <p> He\'s also very interested in the <span>political current events.</span></p>
        <span class="brs"></span>
        <p>He has a quite <span>critical perspective on political corruption - he gets angry, swears sometimes..</span></p>

        <br>
        <p>He does <span>like me quite a bit.</span></p>
        <span class="brs"></span>
        <p>He makes conversation with me <span>more than his daughter or son.</span></p>
        <span class="brs"></span>
        <p>I\'m also the one who <span>listens to him the most.</span></p>
        <span class="brs"></span>
        <p>So I guess another way of him <span>showing affection is chatting with me about different topics..</span></p>

        <br>
        <p>"His <span>career</span> was <span>extremely important</span> in his life.</p>
        <span class="brs"></span>
        <p>Almost <span>everything</span> in his life to him.</span></p>
        <span class="brs"></span>
        <p>For <span>korean men</span> at that time, you could say that one\'s career withheld ultimate importance in his life.</span></p>

        <br>
        <p>"His relationship with me is quite <span>standard.</span></p>
        <span class="brs"></span>
        <p>He talks to me the <span>most.</span></p>
        <span class="brs"></span>
        <p>Talks to me more than he does with <span>his children.</span></p>


        <br>
        <p>"His <span>hearing is quite bad..</span></p>
        <span class="brs"></span>
        <p>You need to shout right in front of him and I think I <span>tried to initiate a proper conversation</span> with him only <span>once</span> in my life, last summer.</p>
        <span class="brs"></span>
        <p>He doesn\'t really understand long sentences and calling is practically <span>impossible."</span></p>

        <br>

        <p>"I think his communication abilities are quite <span>low.</span></p>
        <span class="brs"></span>
        <p>Though I don\'t know if he\'s like that only to our family.</p>
        <span class="brs"></span>
        <p><span>I haven\'t had a proper conversation with him ever, in my life.</span></p>
        <span class="brs"></span>
        <p>I don\'t think I even told him much about myself. He <span>doesn\'t seem curious either..</span></p> 
        <span class="brs"></span>
        <p>I think he\'s <span>generally disinterested in other people\'s' personal life. </span> </p>
        <br>

        <br>

        <p>"My relationship with grandpa is quite <span>distant,</span> I would say.</p>
        <span class="brs"></span>
        <p>I think all of my conversations with him throughout life lasted a minute long except once last summer..</p>
        <span class="brs"></span>
        <p>He\'s really chill though, so I\'m fine with that.</p> 
        <span class="brs"></span>
        <p>He does always <span>checks up with me,</span> whether it be asking me or mom if <span>I\'m okay"</span> </p>
        <br>

        <p>"He doesn\'t have questions that go <span>beyond the surface-level check-ups.</span></p>
        <span class="brs"></span>
        <p>I don/'t think family is as important to him as it is to other typical grandparents..</p>
        <span class="brs"></span>
        <p>The conversations we have are practically <span>identical each and everytime.</span></p> 
        <span class="brs"></span>
        <p>He\'s pretty repetitive and has a clear character.. Cares about his health a lot."</p>
        <br>

        <p>"I normally answer <span>yes</span> to most of his questions because there isn't another way to answer them from the first place to be honest.. </p>
        <span class="brs"></span>
        <p>I really <span>don\'t know much about him.</span></p>
        <span class="brs"></span>
        <p>It\'s probably the same for him. It just <span>wouldn\'t have occurred to him."</span></p> 
        <br>

        <p>"I think he likes my mom and my dad, because he always talks to them more.</p>
        <span class="brs"></span>
        <p>He always asks me about my mom\'s health, whether she\'s alright. So I think he cares about her a lot.</span></p>
        <span class="brs"></span>
        <p>With dad, he definitely talks a lot.</p> 
        <span class="brs"></span>
        <p>Even to my brother he talks more than he does with me.</p> 
        <span class="brs"></span>
        <p>Now that I think about it.. I do feel like the odd one out.. But doesn\'t really make me sad or anything..</p> 
        <br>

        <p>"He <span>always. And really always.</span> Ends our calls by saying <span>"okay now let me talk to your mom"..</span></p>
        <span class="brs"></span>
        <p>I wonder what they would talk about to have a <span>longer conversation than ours..</span></p>

        <br>

        <p><span>"He really can\'t hear.</span></p>
        <span class="brs"></span>
        <p>He can\'t understand complex sentences <span>other than basic phrases </span>like hello, take care, etc.</p>
        <span class="brs"></span>
        <p>You can\'t have daily conversations about any other topic.</p> 
        <br>

        <p><span>" He doesn\'t obsess over contacting each other.</span></p>
        <span class="brs"></span>
        <p>Like, about <span>receiving something first,</span> whether that be emotions or objects.</p>
        <span class="brs"></span>
        <p>My dad <span>never really cared about the give-and-take of emotions.</span></p> 
        <br>

    
        <p>"And he <span>hates change.</span></p>
        <span class="brs"></span>
        <p>Even from the start he never wanted to accept change so now even if he wanted to, <span>he wouldn\'t be able to.</span></p>
        <span class="brs"></span>
        <p>I think he might regret those times himself.</p> 
        <span class="brs"></span>
        <p>For example, whenever we moved houses, it needed to be in front of a mountain. So he didn\'t like to live in the center, in some neighborhoods just because there weren\'t mountains." </p> 
        <br>

        <p>" He <span>doesn\'t</span> communicate at all."</p>
        <span class="brs"></span>
        <p>He doesn\'t <span>try</span> to, and I don\'t know if it\'s because <span>he doesn\'t want to</span>, or if he doesn\'t <span>know how to.</span></p>
        <span class="brs"></span>
        <p>The conversations we normally have <span>can\'t be called communication,</span> it\'s more like each of us <span>checking that we\'re alive. "</span></p> 
        <br>

        <p>"The conversation is always so <span>repetitive.</span> </p>
        <span class="brs"></span>
        <p><span>Always...</span>always hello, how are you, nothing\'s wrong right, i\'m good, goodbye.. take care... Like that.</p>
        <span class="brs"></span>
        <p><span>You could be talking to a stranger." </span></p> 
        <br>

        <p>"He usually checks how I\'m doing then tells me to call my brother.</p>
        <span class="brs"></span>
        <p>I don\'t think they call each other, brother and dad, especially because his <span>hearing became worse.</span></p>
        <span class="brs"></span>
        <p>I try to call him at least once a week, or even twice. </p>
        <span class="brs"></span>
        <p>He doesn\'t know how to check messages..</p> 
        <br>

        <p>"If I call him, you know the calls usually last <span>one minute and thirty seconds.</span> At the most 3 minutes 30 seconds and <span>4 minutes is an achievement.</span></p>
        <span class="brs"></span>
        <p>We usually finish within <span>two minutes,</span> even if we meet <span>in person.</span></p>
        <span class="brs"></span>
        <p>We talk about <span>my husband</span> most of the times, his <span>work</span> and everything.</p>
        <span class="brs"></span>
        <p>He doesn\'t really ask me anything more because he\'s <span>not too curious</span> and <span>I don\'t say much either…</span> </p> 

        <br>

        <p>"If I tell him to <span>stay safe</span> or be <span>careful of corona,</span> he always says it\'s okay because he doesn\'t meet anyone..</p>
        <span class="brs"></span>
        <p> The rest of the conversation <span>doesn\'t work out</span> because of his hearing.</p>
        <span class="brs"></span>
        <p>He <span>already can\'t make much conversation</span> but on top of that has hearing problems.. </p>
        <br>
